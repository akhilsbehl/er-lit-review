# Entity Resolution & Record Linkage
## A literature review

### A theory for record linkage, Fellegi & Sunter, JASA (1969)

* Identifies three scenarios: link, non-link, and _possible_ link.
* Proposes a linkage rule that is designed analogously to a hypothesis test inasmuch as it minimizes the rate of classifiying as _possible link_ for given rates of error in classifying as _link_ and _non-link_.
